# Chasqui
Chasqui is an application created for the Chilean national tournament called "EmprendeXChile". It has a social scope, where entrepeneours get a chance to access E-commerce without having to deal with any kind of commissions or suscription costs.

This application was created using *React* for the frontend, and *Flask* for its backend. I must state that this was the first instance where I did any kind of user authentication. I must say at the same time that this is the first time I seriously tried to create a frontend, which definitely looks way better than my prior ones. However, I still believe that there is a lot to improve.

Be free to browse through the code, maybe, you could find something educational. Remember, I'm a junior dev :D.
